# Teachable Course Timer Extension

A Microsoft Edge extension that analyzes Teachable course pages to extract course structure and calculate total estimated course time.

## Features

- **Course Analysis**: Extracts all sections and lessons from Teachable course pages
- **Time Estimation**: Calculates total estimated course duration (10 minutes per lesson average)
- **Section Breakdown**: Shows detailed information for each course section
- **Export Functionality**: Copy course data to clipboard for external use
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient interface with glassmorphism effects
- **Real-time Detection**: Automatically detects course pages and shows a floating widget

## Installation

1. Download all the extension files:
2. Load the extension in Microsoft Edge:
   - Open Edge and go to `edge://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing your extension files

## Usage

1. Navigate to any Programming Advices course page where you're enrolled
2. Click the Teachable Course Timer extension icon in your toolbar
3. Click "üîç Analyze Course" to extract course data
4. View the results:
   - Total number of sections
   - Total number of lessons
   - Estimated total time
   - Detailed section breakdown
5. Click "üìã Copy Course Data" to export the information

## How It Works

The extension analyzes the HTML structure of Teachable course pages, specifically looking for:

- `.course-section` containers that hold course sections
- `.section-title` elements for section names
- `.section-item` elements for individual lessons
- `.lecture-name` elements for lesson titles

### Time Estimation

The extension estimates course duration using an average of 10 minutes per lesson. This is a reasonable estimate for most online courses, but actual times may vary based on:

- Lesson complexity
- Video length
- Reading materials
- Assignments and quizzes
